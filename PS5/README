The document titled "CHEME 7770 PS5" includes solutions for all parts of the problems in the problem set.
The coding for problems 2 and 3 can be found in their respective folders.
The code files for problem 2, parts B and C, are titled the "PhasePortraitV2" and "PartsBC". This code is a modified version of the code provided by Professor Paszek. 
The code files for Part D are Matlab files titled "Part D" and "osc." You must open osc and have it in the same directory for the "Part D" code to work and plot the ODEs.
The code files for problem 3, parts B, are titled "PartB-1/2". This code is a modified version of the code provided by Professor Paszek. 
The code file for Part D  Matlab files titled "Part D"
